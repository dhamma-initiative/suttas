## Context
* Others are benefited when one help clarify what is Dhamma and what is not-Dhamma
* Others are benefited when one helps arouse non-greed, non-aversion and non-delusion in others
* Dhamma represents a graduated set of instructions & qualities that honour causality leading to true and lasting happiness that is underpinned by discernment
* Not-Dhamma in contrast is not based on causality, perpetuates samsara and underpinned by delusion
* True Dhamma is frequently captured with the dependent co-arising formulas:
    1. When this is, that is.
    2. From the arising of this comes the arising of that.
    3. When this isn't, that isn't.
    4. From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that.
