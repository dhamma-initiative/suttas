# Welcome to the dhamma-initiatives Handful of leaves

This site is an attempt to model the Buddha's messages as Unified Modeling Language (UML) Models.

I am a student of Ajaan Geoff (aka Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu) and use his translations of the Pali Canon exclusively.

I will slowly work work my way through Ajaan Geoff's translations of the Sutta Piṭaka.

May you find the causes for true and lasting happiness and act on them.
